A slice can be identified as a screen then a command then one or more events, an automation is an automation element, a command and then one or more events.
A transalation is first one external event, an automation, a command and one or events. All elements are linked with a FLOW.
That's left is the slice READ MODEL that could link then to a SCREEN if that SCREEN does not belong to a flow Screen then command then Events.
Screen are always row 1,2 or more, commands and events row 0 and events rows -1, -2, or less. External Events: always the lowel level.

Multi-event branching from single commands: put events column by column so one after each other.

Back-flow positioning rules: just arrow from the 2 elements, no positioning required
